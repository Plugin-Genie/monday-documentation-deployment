<h2 id="app-usage">App Usage</h2>
<p>The Microsoft Power Automate app installed from the monday.com marketplace contains a Power Automate App Usage view. This view can be added to a board to track the number of executions of each trigger/action per month. It&#39;s useful to make sure you don&#39;t exceed your subscription limits. If you need more executions than your subscription currently allows, the board also contains a button to upgrade your plan to a higher tier.</p>

Now it is no longer working and I&#39;m unable to successfully execute actions/triggers in the monday connector. How do I fix the connector?</h3>

At the top, click the &quot;Switch account&quot; button. This brings up a popup to re-authenticate your connection between monday.com and Power Automate. Click the Authorize button at the bottom of the popup. Your connection should now be restored and your actions/triggers should work again.</p>
